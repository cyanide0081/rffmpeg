## Installation
 
> In order to use this tool you will have to:
> 
> 1. download a build of [**FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
> 
> 2. add _*/ffmpeg/bin_ to your `PATH` environment variable
> 
> 3. download the latest build of this tool from [**here**](https://github.com/cyanide0081/rffmpeg/releases)
> 
> 4. (**optional**) put *rffmpeg.exe* in your _*/ffmpeg/bin_ folder so you can call it from any directory



## Usage

> - This tool's argument syntax is not that different from FFmpeg itself, with the basic structure being:
> 
> `rffmpeg -path <in-path> -fmt <in-fmt(s)> -opts <parameters> -ext <out-ext>`
>
> - Here's an example of a basic RFFmpeg command:
>
> `rffmpeg -path C:\Users\Music -fmt wav -ext mp3`
>
> ### Arguments:
>
> - **path** : must hold a valid directory or else the application will close __*__
>
> - **fmt**  : must hold one or more formats you wish to transcode separated by commas,  
>              as in `-fmt wav,aif,raw` __*__
>
> - **opts** : can hold ffmpeg conversion parameters (**and must be sorrounded by double-quotes**),
>              as in `-opts "-c:a libmp3lame -b:a 256k -ar 44100"` 
>
> - **ext**  : must hold the extension your output files will use __*__
>
> __*__ All arguments marked with an asterisk are required for the tool to work
>
> ### Additional Flags
>
> - You can also pass any of the flags below to help you organize your batch conversions a little
>
> **--newfolder**   : puts your converted files inside a new folder to which you can assign a custom name,  
>                     as in `--newfolder=안녕하세요`
>
> **--delete**      : deletes you original files permanently
>
> **--overwrite**   : automatically overwrites files if they conflict with the output files generated by FFmpeg  
>                     (the program appends an index by default)
>
