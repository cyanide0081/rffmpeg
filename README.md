# **RFFmpeg**

    Windows command-line/console window tool for automating FFmpeg file conversions inside a specific directory

* Run with `--help` to read the help page

<br>

## **Installation**

    In order to use this tool you will first need to install FFmpeg, so here are two ways to do it:

<br>

### **Method 1:** Using _winget_ (recommended)

    If you're using Windows 10.1709 or newer, you can install it by simply opening PowerShell and running: 

> \> `winget install ffmpeg`

<br>

### **Method 2:** Downloading it directly

>
>1. download the latest Windows build of [**FFmpeg**](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip)
>     
> 2. Extract the archive and add the _C:\ffmpeg\bin_ folder - the one containing the executables - to your `PATH`  by running PS as admin and pasting the following command: 
>    
>  \> `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";C:\ffmpeg\bin", [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)`
>   
> 3. (**optional**) move _rffmpeg.exe_ to your _C:\ffmpeg\bin_ folder so you can call it from any directory

<br>

## **Usage**

    This tool's argument syntax is not that different from FFmpeg itself, with the basic structure being:
> 
> \> `rffmpeg -path <in-path> -fmt <in-fmt(s)> -opts <parameters> -ext <out-ext>`
>
    Here's a basic RFFmpeg command that looks for wav files and converts them to mp3:
>
> \> `rffmpeg -path C:\Users\Music -fmt wav -ext mp3`
>  

<br>

 ## **Arguments**
> - **path** : must hold a valid directory or else the application will close __*__
>
> - **fmt**  : must hold one or more formats you wish to transcode separated by commas,  
>              as in `-fmt wav,aif,raw` __*__
>
> - **opts** : can hold ffmpeg conversion parameters (**and must be sorrounded by double-quotes**),  
>              as in `-opts "-c:a libmp3lame -b:a 256k -ar 44100"` 
>
> - **ext**  : must hold the extension your output files will use __*__
>
     * All arguments marked with an asterisk are required for the tool to work

<br>

 ## **Additional Flags**
> You can also pass any of the flags below to help you organize your batch conversions a little
>
> - **--newfolder**   : puts your converted files inside a new folder to which you can assign a custom name,  
>                     as in `--newfolder=你好`
>
> - **--delete**      : deletes the original files permanently after conversion
>
> - **--overwrite**   : automatically overwrites files if they conflict with the output files generated by FFmpeg  
>                     (the program appends an index by default)
>
> - **--norecursion** : disables file searches inside subfolders, in case your directory contains many folders you  
>                     don't want to mess with
