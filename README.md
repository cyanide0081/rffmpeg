# rffmpeg

command-line tool for automating file conversion through inside directories on Windows

- run with **--help** to get the full manual

#### dependencies

- to use this tool you need to have [*ffmpeg*](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed

- to run it, either:

  a. add ffmpeg\bin to your environment variables

  b. copy the *ffmpeg* executable to the same directory as *rffmpeg*
  

- **p.s.:** for whatever reason the executable is blocked by smartscreen by default
